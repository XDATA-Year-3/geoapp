geoapp
======

This is a girder (https://github.com/girder/girder) and geojs
(https://github.com/OpenGeoscience/geojs) based app for examining the XData
data sets for 2015.

Currently, only the NYC-Taxi data is used.

The app probably won't work outside of Kitware's internal network without
changing the data sources.

See notes.txt for a build script.
