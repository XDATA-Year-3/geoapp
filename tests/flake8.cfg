# Ignore certain errors.
#   If an ignore line is not specified, the pep8 module defaults to
# E123,E133,E226,E241,E242.  We didn't have any E133 or E242 errors, so don't
# ignore those.  The errors we suppress are:
#  E123 - closing bracket does not match indentation of opening bracket's line
#  E226 - missing whitespace around arithmetic operator
#  E241 - multiple spaces after ,
#   By including the flake8-docstrings module, we also will fail on PEP257
# errors (D...).  For the moment, supress all of the D... errors that would
# cause us to fail.  We may want to revisit this to make out code more PEP257
# conformant.
#  D10{0,1,2,3} - Public {module,class,method,function} docstring missing.
#  D200 - One-line docstrings should fit on one line with quotes.
#  D20{1,2} - No blank lines allowed {before,after} docstring.
#  D20{3,4} - 1 blank required {before,after} class docstring.
#  D205 - Blank line required between one-line summary and description.
#  D208 - Docstring over-indented.
#  D209 - Put multi-line docstring closing quotes on separate line.
#  D300 - Use """triple double quotes""".
#  D400 - First line should end with a period.
#  D401 - First line should be in imperative mood.
#  D402 - First line should not be the function's "signature".
