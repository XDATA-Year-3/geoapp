Minerva Taxi provides a way to examine two data sets from 2013 concentrated in
New York City.  The data sets are:

* **Taxicab Trips**
    This includes all yellow cab trips in Mahattan and some of the green cab
    trips from the nearby area.  The data includes pickup and dropoff locations
    and time, plus a variety of other data.  Around 173 million trips are in
    the database.

* **Instagram Messages**
    This is a subset of Instagram messages that were in the greater New York
    area.  Around 7.5 million messages are in the database.

* **Twitter Messages**
    This is a subset of Twitter messages that were in the greater New York
    area.  Around 12.5 million messages are in the database.

There is some additional data that can be plotted on graphs, but not on the map:

* **Central Park Weather**
      There is daily information on temperature, wind, precipitation and other values.
  
* **Taxi Statistical Trends**
    The taxi activity was processed using a statistical modeling package to determine what consisted of routine activity and what was unusual activity.
