GeoApp: Data Analysis Tool
==========================

Data Sources
------------

GeoApp provides a way to examine two data sets from 2013 concentrated in New
York City.  The two data sets are:

* **Taxicab Trips**
    This includes all yellow cab trips in Mahattan and some of the green cab
    trips from the nearby area.  The data includes pickup and dropoff locations
    and time, plus a variety of other data.  Around 173 million trips are in
    the database.

* **Instagram Messages**
    This is a subset of Instagram messages that were in the greater New York
    area.  Around 7.5 million messages are in the database.

There is some addition data that can be plotted on graphs, but not on the map:

* **Central Park Weather**
      There is daily information on temperature, wind, precipitation and other values.
  
* **Taxi Statistical Trends**
    The taxi activity was processed usign a statistical modelling package to determine what conisted of routine activity and what was unusual activity.

The base map can be changed using the **Tile Set** option in the **Display** panel.  It can be made more or less visible with the **Opacity** slider next to the Tile Set Option.

A specific area of the map can be centered by selecting one of the location buttons (**Manhattan**, **Midtown**, or **Times Sq.**).

Selecting Data

Data is selected in the **Filters** panel.
